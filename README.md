# HangManGame ðŸŽ®

![Hangman Game](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.k5dAenZuFM_CNVHOTiJxawHaNK&pid=Api)  

Welcome to the HangManGame repository! This project is a classic Hangman game built using React. It includes a backend service, `wordServer`, that provides words for the game.

## About HangManGame  

HangManGame is a web-based implementation of the classic Hangman word-guessing game. Players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to completing the hangman figure, and the game is lost if the figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed.
